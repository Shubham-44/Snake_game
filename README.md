# Snake_game
 The Snake Game, made with Python's Turtle module, lets players control a snake to eat food and grow longer. Avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's body is the main challenge. Featuring simple graphics and responsive controls, this game is a fun way to learn Python basics, including event handling and collision detection.
